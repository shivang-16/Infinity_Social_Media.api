# Social Media App Backend

## Project Overview
The Social Media App Backend serves as the core infrastructure for a social networking platform. It provides a comprehensive set of APIs and services for user management, post creation, interaction with posts, and user connections. The backend is designed to be easily deployable on various server platforms, such as Vercel or Netlify, making it accessible for integration into your own website or application.

## GitHub Repository
You can access the source code and project files on the GitHub repository: [Social Media App Backend Repository](https://github.com/shivang-16/Social_Media_App_Backend)

## Deployment and Integration
The backend is deployable on various server platforms, including Vercel and Netlify. Once deployed, you can seamlessly integrate it into your frontend application, enabling users to register, create posts, interact with content, and establish connections on your social media platform. To get started:

### Starting the Server
To start the backend server, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for the backend.

**Step 2: Start the Server**
- Run `npm start` to launch the server using Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are made. If you don't have Nodemon installed, you can do so globally by running `npm i -g nodemon`. This will install Nodemon globally on your PC.

These two steps will initiate the backend server, allowing you to access the APIs and services provided by the Social Media App Backend. Ensure that your environment variables are correctly set to enable seamless server operation.

## Environment Variables
To run and deploy the backend successfully, you need to configure the following environment variables based on your deployment environment (Development, Preview, Production):

- **FRONTEND_URL:** The URL of the frontend application that will communicate with this backend. For example, during development, use "http://localhost:3000," and when you deploy your frontend, update this variable with the actual frontend URL.
- **MONGO_URI:** `<your MongoDB uri here>` The URI to connect to your MongoDB database, where user and post data are stored. Since I've used MongoDB in this project, make sure to replace with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- **CLOUDINARY_API_KEY:** Your Cloudinary API key for handling image and video uploads.
- **CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET:** Your Cloudinary API secret for secure access to the Cloudinary service.
- **CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME:** Your Cloudinary cloud name, identifying your Cloudinary account.
- **SMTP_USER:** Your email address through which you want to send emails using Nodemailer.
- **SMTP_PASS:** This is not your Gmail password. To obtain the correct value, go to your Google Account settings, search for "App passwords," create a new app password, and use that generated password.
- **SMTP_SERVICE:** Use "gmail" as the SMTP service provider.
- **SMTP_PORT:** Set this to "465," which is the port number for the SMTP service.
- **SMTP_HOST:** Use "smtp.gmail.com" as the host or server address for the SMTP service.
- **NODE_ENV:** Set it to "Production" to indicate the production environment.
- **JWT_SECRET:** Your secret key for generating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication and authorization.
- **PORT:** The port on which the backend server will listen for incoming requests.

These environment variables are crucial for the proper functioning and security of the backend. You should set them according to your deployment environment and the services you're using.

With this backend in place and properly configured, you can build and integrate your frontend application to create a fully functional social media platform. Users will be able to register, log in, create and interact with posts, follow/unfollow other users, and more, all powered by this backend infrastructure.

## API Documentation
For in-depth details and comprehensive documentation of the API endpoints, you can explore my Postman collection. This collection offers a well-structured and interactive guide to using the Social Media App Backend:
